			<h2>Teaching</h2>
			<p>I was the winner of Binghamton University's Harpur College of Arts and Sciences 2017 Teaching Award - Best Instructor of Graduate Classes, receiving the most nominations among 384 different Harpur instructors nominated by graduate students. Selected anonymous comments from students for my teaching:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“Dr. Wu is the absolute best!!! He's so student-oriented and helpful! I didn't think programming or coding was something I could ever do, but he made it possible! We all love him!”</p>
				<p>“Dr. Wu made himself available all the time and made sure to allow students to ask questions before continuing. He is an excellent teacher and I consider him a friend and mentor.”</p>
				<p>“Very articulate and creative teaching method. Never a dull moment in class. Always makes students feel appreciated and welcomed.”</p>
				<p>“Professional and practical. Extremely versed in all fields of subject matter. Pushes students to achieve more than they ever thought was possible. Always approachable and supportive.”</p>
				<p>“Dr. Wu is an awesome guy, and someone I honestly look to as a standard of professionalism and self-motivation. I highly recommend him as a professor to anyone in the Geography Department. He knows pretty much everything about ArcGIS, programming, stats … you name it. Thanks to him, I’ve learned much more about my field and topics I had tried to tackle on my own to no avail.”</p>
				<p>“Its honestly not hard to see why professor Wu would win such a prestigious award. He is fiercely intelligent, yet humble. He is genuinely devoted to his job and goes above and beyond to make sure his students are prepared to succeed.”</p>
				<p>“Dr. Wu, I just wanted to thank you for giving me the opportunity to learn Python. It has come in handy so many times in my new position as a GIS Analyst. I am able to solve data integration and standardizing issues that otherwise would make processes impossible. So thank you very much!!”</p>
